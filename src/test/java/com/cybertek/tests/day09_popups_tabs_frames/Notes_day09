Popups,alerts,Iframes,Windows
=====================
Popups,alerts,modal,dialog,overlay --> anything pop ups on the webpage.

How to handle pop ups???

we have 2 different way of handling pop ups, based on their structure:

1.HTML POP UPS
-If the pop up is from html, we deal with it as if it is another web element.

2.JAVASCRIPT ALERTS
-Second types of pop up comes from javascript, mostly known as js alerts.
-We CANNOT right click on those alerts to see html(inspect)

To deal with non html alerts, we have special class from selenium which is Alert

How to point the alert ?

Alert alert = driver.switchTo().alert();

And we have accept, dismiss, sendkeys, getText method for alerts.

If there is no alert on the webpage, and we try to switch,
NoAlertPresentException: no such alert


*****

Set<String> windowHandles = driver.getWindowHandles();
-It's one of the collection. Just like a list but with two difference:
1- It doesnt keep duplicate values. Only keeps unique values.
2- It doesnt keep the order. You can not use index. You can not navigate with index.

*****
Disable Chrome Notifications

Map<String, Object> prefs = new HashMap<String, Object>();
prefs.put("profile.default_content_setting_values.notifications", 2);
ChromeOptions options = new ChromeOptions();
options.setExperimentalOption("prefs", prefs);
WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(options);

*****
Tab and Windows
-In selenium there is no difference between tabs and windows.
-By default selenium controls one html page.
-When we open the page first time it points that page only.
-When we open a new tab/window, it will still be looking at the old window.
-To do any interaction with the new window we have to switch to new window.

driver.getWindowHandle(); --> this returns some unique code belongs the windows that
we open with driver.get()

handle--> unique identifier for windows
driver.getWindowHandle() --> returns the handle of the current windows

driver.getWindowHandles()--> returns the set of the all open windows.

HOW TO HANDLE MORE THEN 2 WINDOWS/TABS in SELENIUM
If you have more then 2 windows, we need some unique identifier for us like title, url etc.
Then based on our identifier we will keep switching windows until we find our expected window.
