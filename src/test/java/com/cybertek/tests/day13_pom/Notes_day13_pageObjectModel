Page Object Model

Page Object Model --> this is a design pattern that enhances the ease of maintenance and reusability.
It is a class that mirrors the behavior and object(web elements) of a webpage from the app.
In page object model we create classes that serve as an object repository.

Page Object Model vs PageFactory

Page Object Model --> design pattern in selenium
PageFactory --> is class in selenium using which we can create page object model.

@FindBy --> annotation from selenium, used to provide locator for the web elements

***--> if you target more than one element you can keep them inside of List<Element>.


@FindAll --> gives us option to use multiple locators,
if at least one of them is matching it will find the web element

@FindAll({
@FindBy(id = "prependedInput"),
@FindBy(name ="_username")
})

@FindBys --> if all locators are matching with element then it will return it.
AND logic applies here.

@FindBys({
@FindBy(id = "prependedInput"),
@FindBy(name ="_username")
})
======================================
BasePage --> will contain elements and functionalities that are common on other pages.
