List of WebElements

driver.findElements();
we were trying to locate one element until now.
We will learn how to locate multiple elements and interact with it.

1.Find common locators for the elements that you want to locate
2.pass your locator to findElements method
3.List<WebElement> buttons = driver.findElements(yourLocator)

after this point, buttons keep list of web elements,
we have to reach them to apply selenium methods either with loop or .get() list method

findElements() method does not throw NoSuchElementException,
if you locator is wrong it will return you empty list.

We should verify everytime the size of list.

==============================
DROPDOWNS
Dropdown menu is a menu that offers a list of options.
Most of the time we only allowed to choose one option.

1. condition === select -->html tag
                 Select class --> class from selenium

SELECT class only works with the web element which has select tag.
How to use SELECT class
1.make sure the dropdown has select tag.
2.locate the dropdown just like any other element
3.create object using Select class by passing the element that we locate steop 2 as a constructor

SELECT methods

getOptions() --> returns all tge available options from the dropdown list.

getFirstSelectedOption()--> returns web element, first selected option
.getFirstSelectedOption().getText() --> the current selected option.

==============================

HOW TO SELECT OPTION FROM DROPDOWN

1.Using Visible Text
selectByVisibleText("text") -->selecting based on the visible text of options

2.Using index Number
selectByIndex(indexNumber) -->select based on index of options(starts from 0)

3.using value attribute
selectByValue(option value) --> select based on value of value attribute

NO SELECT DROPDOWN

-When we try to use Select class with the dropdown which does NOT have select tag,
we got UnexpectedTagNameException: Element should have been "select" but was "a"

-If we dont have select tag, we locate dropdown just like any other web elements
and to see options with clicking or hovering over to it.

-To get all options from dropdown, we can use common locator between
them(exp:classname, tagname etc)
-then we can use List methods to get the size and expected options from list.

-we use click() method to click different options, we can either locate
the option separately or use index of the option from the list.
