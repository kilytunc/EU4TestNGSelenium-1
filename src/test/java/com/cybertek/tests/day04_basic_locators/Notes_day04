How to identify web elements ?
1.Navigate to website
2.Open the source(inspect)
3.Find the unique property for the element
===================
driver--> our page,browser
driver.findElement()-->method used to find weblement on the page
By is a selenium class for locators.
===================
Basic locators
we have 8 different locators

id
name
tagName
className
linkText
PartialLinkText
xPath (1 class)
CSS(1 class)
==================
first locator
ID --> it will be always unique and the first locator we are looking for. If there is and id attrivute avaialabe for ewebelement we will check is it dynamic or not.
If it is NOT changing --static-- we will use it.

How to understand ID value is changing(dynamic) ?

while we inspecting the element, refresh the webpage, if id value are changing we CONNOT use it. refresh couple of times always to make sure.
========================
Name
if we cannot use id, or it is dynamic we look for the name.
name locator is not dynamic %99.99 time.

name can be duplicate(radio buttons) so be careful.
========================
if we cannot find name or id, we look for tagName

<input type="text" name="full_name">

input--> tag here
rest is attribute and value

Selenium reads the source code from top to bottom.
if your locators matched with one webelement, selenium stops there.

if there is no id or name, we can use tagName based on two conditions
1.tag should be used only one time
2.there are multipe same tags but you want to point the first tag.

we cannot use index when we use tagName locator.
If there are multiple usage of same tag, we cannot point the second one.
====================
className
another attribute for locating web elements

we will use it later to locate multiple elements in one shot.

when we shouldn't use classname locator ?
if there is a space in the class attribute value, we CANNOT USE it.
driver.findElement(By.className(""))
====================
linkText
partialLinkText

linkText --> using full text of link to locate link web element on the webpage
partialLinkText--> using part of the linkText to locate link web element
