Test code/script ----------------test data
test data-->excel file,json,xml,csv,database,api

In DDF(Data Driven Framework) we seperate test data and test code.
we design our test code in a way that it can read the test data
and execute tests base on it. Our test code will have the test steps. Test input data will be in external sources.
Our test data will decide how many times a test case runs.

we use apache-poi dependencies to work with office(excel) files.
