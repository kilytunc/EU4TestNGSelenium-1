-In order to create dynamic path of the files that we are using in our tests cases,
we have to locate our project folder dynamically.

-This method will find where your project is located in your computer.
String projectPath = System.getProperty("user.dir");

-Then we will add the relative file path which is after project location;
String filePath = "src/test/resources/textfile.txt";

-And finally we will concat those two and give as a absolute path to sendKeys method.
String fullPath = projectPath+"/"+filePath;
